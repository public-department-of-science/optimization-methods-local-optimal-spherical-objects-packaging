Hello there!

My name is Bohdan Skrypka. I'm a Software \ Science engineer.

This block of information will be about science things I worked on. Some of my investigations and works 
you can find here mapped by folders (directions):
- optimization-methods

Included next folders here:
-- (Actual on 2019y-worlds best solutions to compare with my solutions) = public information from the globe internet to compare the result I had with world bests.
-- Books-optimization = books I read and used to find formulas
-- Combined-simple-objects-pictures = pictures for combined objects (approximation technique) as saved
-- Modeling-mathematical-experiments = result to prove experiments I did on modeling phase
-- Presentation = folder with files I prepared for presenting results I had
-- Science-theses-articles-conclusions = files with my published materials and conclusions by experiments provided by me on mathematical modeling
-- Software = the folder include all the things with code I worked on and fully implemented by me, excluding external references (like NuGet \ COM objects, IPOPT external package to use). That folder including programs for local solution finding scripts for over than 40 different problems to solve.
-- Video-materials = include some video-materials I used to have and recorded in process of getting results from the experiments.

3) Optimization-methods: optimal packaging direction.

- In the folder I have my personal dissertation materials: modeling experiments, some publications, software that I implemented, ending with description of new algorithms in the math direction.

In a nutshell, the things I described - everything about optimal packaging of spherical objects into specifica external container. The field of applications for that in many engineering directions such as medicine, aerospace (the first place to use it) etc.

My Science director was: Yakovlev Serhii Vsevolodovych - Honored Worker of Science and Technology of Ukraine, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences, Professor, First Deputy Director for Educational and Scientific Work of the Educational and Scientific Institute of Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs. Head of the Center "Creation and Research of Aerospace Objects and Systems", Professor of Mathematical Modeling and Artificial Intelligence.
