Hello there!

My name is Bohdan Skrypka. I'm a Software \ Science engineer.

This block of information will be about science things I worked on. Some of my investigations and works 
you can find here mapped by folders (directions):
- optimization-methods

Included next folders here:
-- (Actual on 2019y-worlds best solutions to compare with my solutions) = public information from the globe internet to compare the result I had with world bests.
-- Books-optimization = books I read and used to find formulas
-- Combined-simple-objects-pictures = pictures for combined objects (approximation technique) as saved
-- Modeling-mathematical-experiments = result to prove experiments I did on modeling phase
-- Presentation = folder with files I prepared for presenting results I had
-- Science-theses-articles-conclusions = files with my published materials and conclusions by experiments provided by me on mathematical modeling
-- Software = the folder include things with code I worked on and fully implemented by me, excluding external references (like NuGet \ COM objects)
-- Video-materials = include some video-materials I used to have.

=============================
Warning: If you not don't know what the difference between approximation and interpolation - please, stop reading right here,
 that's the simples thing you will read about down below!

If you're looking for something - you'll find that, just take your time.
I'm just kidding, if you want to know smth new from these folders - please, enjoy your reading here.
=============================

3) Optimization-methods: optimal packaging direction.

- In the folder I have my personal dissertation materials from modeling experiments and publishing ending some points to describe such as new algorithms discovering in
the math direction. In a nutshell, the things I described and don't have time to write here - about a super wide field of science things nobody used and implemented yet,
but could be used in many ingineering direction such as medicine, aerospace (the first place to use it) etc.

- Here you can find all the things that is needed to become me as a Phd. in Math,
 but what the reason to have a 'badge' of for that all that you need - just seat on your ass for 4-5 years? - Anyone I can find. :)

My Science director was: Yakovlev Serhiy Vsevolodovych - Honored Worker of Science and Technology of Ukraine, Doctor of Physical and Mathematical Sciences,
 Professor, First Deputy Director for Educational and Scientific Work of the Educational and Scientific Institute of Kharkiv National University of Internal Affairs.
 Head of the Center "Creation and Research of Aerospace Objects and Systems", Professor of Mathematical Modeling and Artificial Intelligence.
